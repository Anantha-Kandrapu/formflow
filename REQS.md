  - Record user input on forms
  - Track field identifiers and values
  - Handle dynamic form changes
  - Store input patterns

- **Execution Mode**
  - Automatically fill forms based on stored patterns
  - Handle dynamic form mutations
  - Provide feedback on fill success/failure

### 2.2 Form Field Handling
- Support for various input types:
  - Text inputs
  - Select dropdowns
  - Checkboxes
  - Radio buttons
  - Textareas
  - Custom form elements
- Handle dynamically generated fields
- Support for nested forms
- Handle field dependencies

### 2.3 Field Identification System
- Multiple identification methods:
  - HTML attributes (id, name, class)
  - XPath
  - Label text
  - Field context
  - Relative positioning
- Fuzzy matching capabilities
- Pattern recognition for similar fields
